Backbone.simplerouter
=====================

This is a Backbone.Router alternative which was originally forked from
https://github.com/boazsender/backbone.routefilter

It runs before & after methods on each route, but more importantly it 
helps you keep your router organised by simplifying the way your route list
works.
